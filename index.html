        <h1>Awakening</h1>
        <p>You wake up in a cold, damp darkness. A throbbing pain pulses in your skull—the aftermath of a blow you don't remember taking.</p>
        <p>Beside you lies a flickering torch. You grasp it, the warmth a small comfort against the chill.</p>
        <p>The light reveals a massive cavern. In its center looms the rotting carcass of a giant wyrm, arrows protruding from its scales. Around it lie the broken bodies of adventurers... your comrades?</p>
        <p>Memory fails you, but instinct screams one thing:</p>
        <p class="highlight">Find the way out.</p>

        <h1>Freedom</h1>
        <p>The cool night air hits your face as you climb the final rung. You pull yourself up, muscles aching, lungs burning, but alive.</p>
        <p>Below you, the darkness of the dungeon remains, holding its secrets and its dead. But you... you are free.</p>
        <p>The stars above have never looked so bright.</p>
        <p class="highlight">You have escaped!</p>
