        title: "Day -3: Preparation",
        text: "The old man at the tavern spoke of the Sunken Citadel with equal parts fear and greed. He claims a Wyrm of immense size slumbers in the lowest depths, guarding a hoard that would shame kings. Alaric, Thorne, and Elara have agreed to the expedition. We spent the day gathering supplies—torches, rope, rations, and weapons. Alaric's blade is sharp, and Elara's spells are prepared. I feel a mix of excitement and dread. What lies beneath those ruins?"

        title: "Day 1: The Ruins",
        text: "We have breached the outer seal. The air here is stale. The first level is a maze of crumbling stone work, choked with roots that have broken through the ceiling. We dispatched a few giant rats, nothing troubling. But the shadows seem to stretch longer than they should. Thorne found a strange coin, pulsating with a faint heat. We press on."

        title: "Day 2: The Sewers",
        text: "The smell is unbearable—stagnant water and ancient filth. This level was once a drainage system for the city above. Green slime coats every surface, making footing treacherous. The skittering sounds are everywhere now. We were ambushed by goblins near the cisterns. Thorne took an arrow to the shoulder—he says he's fine, but the wound is blackening."

        title: "Day 3: The Golden Idols",
        text: "We have descended into what looks like a temple. It feels wrong. Strange golden idols leer at us from the shadows, their eyes seeming to follow our movement. The architecture is majestic but alien. Elara says the magical energy here is suffocating. We found remains of another group today—picked clean. One held a map, but the ink had run into useless stains."

        title: "Day 4: Madness",
        text: "Thorne is dead. The poison took him in the night. He screamed of 'eyes in the walls' before he passed. We had to leave his body in the temple. Elara is... different. She mutters to herself. We found a staircase leading deeper, into cool, dry air. A welcome change from the humidity above, but the silence is heavy."

        title: "Day 5: The Catacombs",
        text: "We are walking through a city of the dead. Thousands of niches line the walls, each holding dusty bones. It goes on forever. We triggered a trap—a wall of spikes that split the corridor. Alaric was on the far side. We shouted to him, but the grinding stone drowned us out. Then the lights went out on his side. We heard him scream, then silence."

        title: "Day 6: The Lair",
        text: "We found it. The Wyrm. We peered into the great cavern from a crack in the rock wall. It matches the legends—scales of iridescent emerald, breath like sulfur. It sleeps atop a mountain of gold. But there is something else... strange eggs? Glowing sacs? We cannot fight it directly. Alaric has a plan to distract it while I steal what I can. It is suicide. We have no choice. The way back is sealed."

        title: "Day 7: Alone",
        text: "The plan failed. Of course it failed. The Wyrm woke before I even touched a coin. Fire... so much fire. Elara didn't even run; she just stood there laughing as the flames took her. I scrambled into a vent shaft. I've been crawling for hours. I can hear it slithering in the rock behind me. My torch is flickering. I am so cold."

        title: "Last Words",
        text: "Leg broken. Can't move. Hiding in a small alcove behind a mimic that—thank the gods—is already dead. If you find this, don't look for the gold. Just run. The Wyrm isn't the true master here. The dungeon itself... it's alive. And it's feeding."
