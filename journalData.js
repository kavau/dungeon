        title: "Day -3: Preparation",
        text: "The old man at the tavern spoke of the Sunken Citadel with equal parts fear and greed. He claims a Wyrm of immense size slumbers in the lowest depths, guarding a hoard that would shame kings. Alaric, Thorne, and Elara have agreed to the expedition. We spent the day gathering supplies—torches, rope, rations, and weapons. Alaric's blade is sharp, and Elara's spells are prepared. I feel a mix of excitement and dread. What lies beneath those ruins?"

        title: "Day 1: The Descent",
        text: "We have breached the outer seal. The air here is stale, heavy with the scent of mold and something metallic—blood? The first level seems to be ancient ruins, overgrown with roots. We dispatched a few giant rats, nothing troubling. But the shadows seem to stretch longer than they should. Thorne found a strange coin, pulsating with a faint heat. We press on."

        title: "Day 2: First Blood",
        text: "We should have turned back. The layout of this place makes no sense. Corridors twist back on themselves; rooms appear where walls stood moments before. We were ambushed by goblins near the water cisterns. Thorne took an arrow to the shoulder—he says he's fine, but the wound is blackening. We found a staircase leading down. The darkness below is absolute."

        title: "Day 4: Madness",
        text: "Thorne is dead. The poison took him in the night. He screamed of 'eyes in the walls' before he passed. We had to leave his body behind. Elara is... different. She mutters to herself, staring at the glowing lichens as if they speak to her. I hear them too, sometimes. A low thrumming sound, like a giant heart beating in the depths. We are running low on torches."

        title: "Day 6: The Lair",
        text: "We found it. The Wyrm. We peered into the great cavern from a crack in the rock wall. It matches the legends—scales of iridescent emerald, breath like sulfur. It sleeps atop a mountain of gold. But there is something else... strange eggs? Glowing sacs? We cannot fight it directly. Alaric has a plan to distract it while I steal what I can. It is suicide. We have no choice. The way back is sealed."
