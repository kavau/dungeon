        text: "The old man at the tavern spoke of the Sunken Citadel with equal parts fear and greed. He claims a Wyrm of immense size slumbers in the lowest depths, guarding a hoard that would shame kings. Alaric, Thorne, and Elara have agreed to the expedition. We spent the day gathering supplies—torches, rope, rations, and weapons. Alaric's blade is sharp, and Elara's spells are prepared. I feel a mix of excitement and dread. What lies beneath those ruins?"

        title: "Day 1: The Ruins",
        text: "We have breached the outer seal. The air here is stale. The first level is a maze of crumbling stone work, choked with roots that have broken through the ceiling. We dispatched a few giant rats, nothing troubling. Packs of goblins roam the upper galleries, but we managed to slip past them unseen. But the shadows seem to stretch longer than they should. Thorne found a strange coin, pulsating with a faint heat. We press on."

        title: "Day 2: The Sewers",
        text: "The smell is unbearable — stagnant water and ancient filth. This level was once a drainage system for the city above. Green slime coats every surface, making footing treacherous. We were ambushed by... things. Wet, pale shapes that splashed in the dark. Thorne was bitten on the arm. He says he is fine, but the wound is weeping black ichor. The strange coin is getting hotter. Thorne keeps rubbing it against the wound. We found inscriptions on the walls today—names, dates, scratched into the slime-slicked stone. 'TURN BACK', 'IT HUNGERS'. The only testament to those who died here."

        title: "Day 3: The Golden Idols",
        text: "We have descended into an ancient, forgotten temple. It feels wrong. Strange golden idols leer at us from the shadows, their eyes seeming to follow our movement. The architecture is majestic but alien. Elara says the magical energy here is suffocating. We found remains of another group today—picked clean. One held a map, but the ink had run into useless stains. The air here holds a surprise—fireflies. Tiny orbs of blue light. The others say they are silent, but I hear them. A high-pitched buzzing that forms words. 'Deeper,' they whisper. 'Bring it to us.' One landed on Alaric's hand and burned him. He doesn't understand. They only burn the unworthy."

        title: "Day 4: Madness",
        text: "Thorne is dead. The black poison took him. He screamed of 'eyes in the walls' before he passed. I took the coin from his cooling hand. It hurts to hold, but the pain focuses my mind. Elara is staring at me. She watches me constantly now, her eyes filled with suspicion. Does she know? Does she want it?"

        title: "Day 5: The Catacombs",
        text: "We are walking through a city of the dead. Thousands of niches line the walls, each holding dusty bones. It goes on forever. The ghosts are everywhere. They have Thorne's face. They have my face. We triggered a trap—or did I trigger it? Alaric was almost crushed. He looks at me with suspicion now. He wants the coin. I can see it in his eyes. Elara laughs at nothing. We are broken, but the coin is singing."

        title: "Day 6: The Lair",
        text: "We found the Wyrm. It sleeps on gold, but it is filth compared to what I hold. Alaric thinks we are here for the hoard. Fool. The coin pulls me toward the deep, dark lake the beast curls around. A mirror to the void. 'Home,' it whispers. Alaric has a plan to distract it. I will let him try. I have my own plan."

        title: "Day 7: Alone",
        text: "They are dead. The beast took them. Alaric screamed my name—he saw me turn away. He saw me smile. I am crawling in the dark now. The coin is so bright so warm. It lights the way. I hear slithering behind me. It is coming to reclaim its own."
